### Matplotlib Tutorial

Matplotlib might be the single most used Python Package for 2D-graphics. It has TONS of features to many to list and come in many different formats. This tutorial is rather confusing to follow and I was unable to get Matplotlib to render.

- [Matplotlib.org](https://matplotlib.org/)  
Here is the official documentation for matplotlib. It shows the various way you can use matplotlib to do visualizations in python. Its built to create static, animated, or interactive visualizations. Think of drawing bar graphs, linegraphs, pie, scatter plots, etc...

I have found a semi-working solution for Window users and that is to save the file instead of actually showing it. Which works somewhat.
Also I followed an online youtube tutorial here [Link to Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UO98lJQ3QGI) which was very informative

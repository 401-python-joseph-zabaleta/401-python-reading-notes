This was a great ted talk! Carol Dweck is a Psychologist who studies why people succeed or don't and how to foster success. During her studies she found a school that instead issuing a failing grade they issued a "Not Yet". This is so optimistic. I right away like the sound of "not yet" over F for failure. I have been lucky to understand this concept without having to be told I have not yet learned something but for those who don't see it that way right away this is great reassurance. This really can make someone see the hope on the otherside of a bad grade or situation.

Angela Lee Duckworth is a Psychologist who studies concepts of self-control and grit to determine how they might predict both acdemic and professional success. This video mainly focus on how grit is a succeeding factor. Not IQ levels not rich/poor status. Just the willingness to keep going, the stamina, the grit to succeed. Grit has no relation to talent and the best idea on how to develop or build grit is having a growth mindset developed by Carol Dweck.

### Ceasar Cipher  
* [Link to Article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher)  
This is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter is in plaintext is replaced by some fixed number position down the alphabet.  

For example:  
`Plain:    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ`  
`Cipher:   XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW`  

`Plaintext:  THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG`  
`Ciphertext: QEB NRFZH YOLTK CLU GRJMP LSBO QEB IXWV ALD`  

The above cypher is done in reverse, with a right shift of 3. This basic concept is all encryption has evolved from.

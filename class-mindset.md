[Link to video](https://www.ted.com/talks/carol_dweck_the_power_of_believing_that_you_can_improve?language=en)  

This was a great ted talk! Carol Dweck is a Psychologist who studies why people succeed or don't and how to foster success. During her studies she found a school that instead issuing a failing grade they issued a "Not Yet". This is so optimistic. I right away like the sound of "not yet" over F for failure. I have been lucky to understand this concept without having to be told I have not yet learned something but for those who don't see it that way right away this is great reassurance. This really can make someone see the hope on the otherside of a bad grade or situation.

Angela Lee Duckworth is a Psychologist who studies concepts of self-control and grit to determine how they might predict both acdemic and professional success. This video mainly focus on how grit is a succeeding factor. Not IQ levels not rich/poor status. Just the willingness to keep going, the stamina, the grit to succeed. Grit has no relation to talent and the best idea on how to develop or build grit is having a growth mindset developed by Carol Dweck.

Alian de Botton is a Swiss-born British philosopher and author. In this TED talk he talks about the relevance to everday life. The main points he talks about leads to success and failure. Success comes with a cost. You are unable to succeed at everything, and when you are successful are one element of life there is another element at loss. Being successful might not mean what we think, and what we want to be. As humans we take in a lot of information from all sources: radio, tv, people, etc... This defines how we view ourselves. "Highly open to suggestions". Ensure we are choosing our own idea of success.

Dr. Sarah Rugheimer and Dr. Sarah Ballard host a podcast called "Self-Care with Drs. Sarah". The main focus is about thriving and being the best researcher you can be in school by taking care of yourself first. Both attended Harvard and graduated with PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Imposter Syndrome is when you feel like you are not comfortable in your own position. Despite all your accomplishments, you dismiss these inside your head and believe you have not actually accomplished anything. This happens a lot for those attending first year of college, or people of color, or women in certain fields. This applies to us here in 401. I can see how some can view this as "unreal". We are taking the "final class" before possible employment. I feel as this exact syndrome, as I do not quite feel as if I am really a software developer due to the fact I feel like I barely know anything about coding at all. There is so much to know. There is a balance to be made. Recognizing the self-doubt that can be harmful and take you out of the running for success is key. One way to combat this syndrome is saying them verbally. Speak them with friends, learn to laugh, and overcome these false ideas.

Podcast with Dr. Sarah Rugheimer and Dr. Ballard part II. Recognizing your own patterns early on we can better combat bad habits. Reflecting on yourself and your accomplishments can help these imposter operators. A journal is a great source of keeping track of self reflections and writing down these patterns and imposter ideas really brings them to life to create strategies to overcome these hurdles. Another study talked about to a technique to curb these imposter situations in your field of study, is to focus your energy on the other parts of your life. Such eating healthy, maintaining good fitness, do things that will fire off other neurons in the brain to stimulate other areas. Here is a link to Dr. Sarah Rughmeimers website. Here she has collected resources for STEM and other studies. [Link](http://www.sarahrugheimer.com/).

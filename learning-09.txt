Class 09 Learning Journal  

Today's lab was a really good intro into AI. Our team spend some time learning how it was built, we talked it over to try and understand how mock print and mock input worked. We were able to play around and implement the AI bot. There is a lot of improvement to be made on this game which will be great to work on our free time. We had to modify the code to fit our version of the game, in the sense that we had a different way of doing the hot_dice feature. This was great since before we could use the AI code , we had to debug and work through it. After the changes we got NerviousNellie to work. We created a version of her but this time it was RiskyBob. RiskyBob was able to play the game and would not bank unless he had less than 2 dice to roll. It was fun to see this in action.  

Whiteboard: This was great, we spent a lot of time talking about this. My partner was not quite sure how these went and I am not 100% on the idea. I have an understanding and was able to walk him through the challenge of the day. When it was my turn , I decided to tackle the same problem to show him how I would do the same problem, and what my wording would be. It was a great success and we both learned a lot. The one suggestion , just like I made in the submission of Code Challenge 09 is that the initial mock interview should be done by someone of experience. This could set a baseline for us to go off of and help both side: candidate and interviewer. Other than that , another day down! Thanks!

Class 32: Learning Journal

Long long day. Played a lot of docker and attempting to make it work with my windows machine. I am glad that I am not alone on the issue but not glad that we all are encountering issues rather than learning more code. However after some time, a solution was met with Skyler. We also learned a lot about docker-compose down vs docker-compose stop. Down will Removing the docker, and its network while the stop will just turn it off or exit. I was also playing around with launching a postgres docker stand alone , outside the app, and then linking the app to it. This might work need more time to learn.

Code Challenge, fun , not fun. Only because it was pushed back into after dinner time frame due to lab issues. I was able to complete the task and more than likely its not the best solution, as in the most efficient but it will accomplish the task at hand. 

Tomorrow, more Authentication!

Thanks,

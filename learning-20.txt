Class 20: Learning Journal

No lecture or lab today, great to take a break and have a full catch up day for labs. I was able to have everything turned in and graded on friday. This brought me back up to 100% leaving me a weekend to rest and prepare for project week. Having the TA's and instructors available was great. Partner power hour was still on and was pretty good as it was a former student talking about DSA challenges / whiteboarding techniques for jobs. She brought up binary search trees and it just so happen we have been working on those this past week. Just a good relaxing day to lead into the weekend.  

Thanks

Class 11: Learning Journal

Lots of new material today. Quite overwhelming to learn and use a whole new system just when we were getting use to python in vscode :D. The good thing about jupyter notebooks its flexible. It has a browser view and also in VSCode options. So we are able to access it different ways, for us Windows users. Nothing new to report as I am still playing catch up with the weekend and reviewing reading notes to ensure I do not fall behind on the tasks. Code Challenge really seemed weird, like you said in class something we would never do in production. Big O of Never hah!.

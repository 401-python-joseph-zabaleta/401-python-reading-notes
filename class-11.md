#### Data Science Nutshell Version
- Data science is the practice of making sense of data by identifying patterns, applying algorithms to extract information, and predict future actions that are suitable for a specific situation.  
- Wikipedia's definition: “Data Science is a combination of scientific methods, algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from data in various forms, both structured and unstructured.”

Data structures can be both unstructured and structured formats.  
- `Unstructured Data`: It does not have a predefined data model. It can be available in audo, video, and text format.  
- `Structured Data`: It is mostly available in a text format which originates from databases or specific file formats like CSV(Comma Seperated Values).  

After categorizing the data, next step is to analyze it.  
- Identify patterns in the data.  
- Understand the data by processing it in such a way that you convert the data into information.  
- This is referred to as `Data Analytics`.  

Once you have analyzed data you want to present it visually so decisions can be made. This is called `Data Visualization`.  
- Raw Data
    - Data Visualization  
        - When human decision is involved data analysis is sufficient.  
        - When machine learns by identifying patters in data, its called Machine Learning  
        - When machine makes decisions on its own, those involving judgements, its called Artifical Intelligence.  

- Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence can take multiple forms for example, in the field of `Natural Language Processing`(NLP).  

- There are many algorithms that are available to process structured and unstructed data for the purposes of Machine Learning. NLP, and AI. This whole field is referred as `Data Science`.  

### What is Jupyter Lab  
* [Link to Article](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting_started/overview.html)  

Overview: JupyterLab is a next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter.  
- JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as:  
    - Jupyter notebooks  
    - Text editors  
    - Terminals  
    - Custom components in a flexible, integrated, and extensible manner.  

- How to Use: JupyterLab:

- You can arrage multiple documents and activities side by side in the work area using tabs and splliters. Documents and activities integrate with each other, enabling new workflows for interactive computer.  

- JupyterLab also offers a unified model for viewing and handling data formats.  
    - Images  
    - CSV  
    - JSON  
    - Markdown  
    - PDF  
    - Vega, Vega-Lite  
    - and the list goes on...  

### Numpy Tutorial  
* [Link to Article](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/numpy-tutorial-python/)  

This is a great tutorial and I can see how useful it is. I set up a demo repo to follow along and it was rather intersting to manipulate the data. I am excited to learn more about Jupyter Notebooks and how to utilize that.

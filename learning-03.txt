Class 03 Learning Journal: 

Today's lecture had a lot of off topic conversations that burnt up some of our time. I feel that that maybe we didn't cover enough for to get through our lab efficiently. I would like to see more examples of similiar problems so have something to relate too. Other than that we briefly covered how python interacts with files. Open and close. Briefly went over exceptions but not quite sure how to use them quite yet. I have been spending a lot of time fighting paths within my code and it has become very frustrating. I could run python somefile.py in terminal, but not in VSCode, then I could run pytest in terminal and vscode but having pathing issues to some files. For the code challenge, I did it utilizing a for loop, but I plan to go back now and change it to utilizing a spliting method or recursively.

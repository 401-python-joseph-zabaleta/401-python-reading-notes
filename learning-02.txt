Class 02 Learning Journal:  

Today we started to learn about unit testing. With the help of poetry and using pytest we are able to run tests that we created on your own python files. We got to do a whole lab on testing which used the fibonacci numbers, which I hated in the prework did not understand them well. Now this time around I was able to see what it was doing and also learn a lot about recursion. Calling a function within itself. Learned about a docstring which was cool to add that little note for our functions so people can get a hint about how it works. Getting better at created a repo locally and adding it to github afterwards. Utilizing poetry to create a project, then establish an enviroment and run our code there. Another solid teaching day, I listen to all the problems that arise even if I do not have them as they give me alternatives answers to future problems.

Class 01 Learning Journal:

We covered class expectations, code of conduct, and being professional. Then we moved into introductions which were very interesting to see the diversity we have and how great this team will be.  To run a program, in python, use Python interpreter and pass it a .py file. We can save our work in files, so that the data persist past writing it in a terminal. For our lab today we worked on command line utility. Started with the basics of print, input() and even a while loop. Doing the prework really helped me accomplish this lab. For the code challenge I was lucky to act upon it early when it was unlocked over the weekend. I have yet to work on my whiteboard skills as this was my first time drawing this out, but again the prework saved me. The overall prework covered a great range of basic and intermediate skills of python. Even if I did understand them then, I was able to reference them now and it helped.  

Lecture was great. Time hacks were on point. Be back in 10 was back in 10, starting on the dot great for learning and ensuring we keep on track with the lesson!

Class 39: Learning Journal

Presentation Day! Learned a bit about our class mates as well as techniques in how to really brand ourselves. This exercise was about being able to present who we are and highlight our skills. I found it beneficial to watch other presentations as they were able to bring new ways of expressing experiences that I did not see or think of. I always like learning from others. Code challenge, was optional which was great, since the day was long and lead into a weekend of actual family time, little vacation. I hope this next week goes well and builds into a great project week!

Thanks,

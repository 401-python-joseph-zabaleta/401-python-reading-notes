Class 04 Learning Journal:

Thanks JB for taking the time to read everyones feedback. As far as yesterday went, I will attempt to make better notes as far as how lecture went so I can be more specific if there is a problem. I had some issues with pathing issues but that was resolved this morning and we are back in business. Code review covered good trouble-shooting techniques. This is how I end up helping fellow classmates sometimes, comment it all out and work piece by piece. The walk through solution part was great! It's a good solution to compare against and see a different way of doing things. I believe your solution if I am not mistaken has Big O problems as it loops letter by letter? This id just a curiousity question. Today's lecture covered classes. I am starting to believe that 201 and 301 javascript or just javascript is wrong. Utilizing objects wrong or calling them wrong. Its not a problem, but this will be an easy transition. Break rooms were good, our team decided to start this breakout utilizing repl.it for real time feedback. 

Lab: I think the hardest part around these labs is we are creating functions, classes, methods, without actually utilizing them. We are "testing" them to make sure they work. I did not finish today's lab I did not quite understand how to pass long the members, to play_solos. I hope to gather better information on this during code review tomorrow or even catch up on this weekend. Thanks!
